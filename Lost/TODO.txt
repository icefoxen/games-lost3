To do next:
Take out drag and put in a max speed
AI behaviors: Arrive, AvoidObstacles, Wander, PathFollow, Separation, Cohesion, Alignment, LeaderFollowing
Steering vectors?
Need to make ships with turrets
Give enemies appropriate weapons
Consider powerups
No friendly fire?
Balance enemy stats some and generally make them better (more)
Better wave combat, a little
Guided missiles
More weapon types


Oh yeah... sound and music.  OpenTK includes OpenAL, theoretically.
Weapon firing
Particles

To do eventually:
Read config file for things like screen size, keybindings, etc.
Multiple lights
AI
Saving and loading
Eventually collision functions should return the point of collision, so we can for instance spawn effects at
that point.

Hey, OpenTK has OpenAL built in, theoretically.
